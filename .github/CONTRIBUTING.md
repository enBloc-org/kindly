# Submitting a new Issue

Everyone is welcome to submit a new Issue to Kindly - whether you intend to resolve it yourself or would just like to raise the awareness of the community to it.

## Before you submit an Issue

Check the backlog for any duplicates - it's possible that someone has already submitted the same issue you've just spotted and having duplicates in the backlog can lead to confusion and a slowdown in development

## How to submit an Issue

Once you reach the **Issues** tab on the Kindly repo and create a new Issue you will be prompted with a template in the **New Issue Description** - please stick to this format and fill in as much detail as possible where prompted.

Include a clear example of the current behaviour with (as much as possible):

- A way to reproduce the problem
- Screenshots of the behaviour
- Information on any triage you've attempted

# Asking for Help

## Help with an Issue

If you have gotten stuck on an Issue you are contributing to and need technical help:

- Update the status of that Issue to `Blocked`. Other developers will be monitoring Issues with this status and prioritising them in their contributions.
- Add a comment to the Issue explaining the help you need

## Help with a question

The `Issues` tab is a working tool for the active development of Kindly, so it should be kept clear of communication not relating to development.

If you have a question or suggetion directly related to an open Issue please use the comments on that Issue ticket to discuss it with anyone working on it / the core team.

If you have a question related to Trafalgar Girls, Kindly or the community at large:

- Check the documentation first - there's a chance your question can be answered by reading the [README](../README.md) file
- Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Chkx4GeZ)

## Finding an Issue

### As a newcomer

If it's your first time submitting code to Kindly and/or you are looking to get acquainted with any one part of our tech stack or code base, we recommending finding an Issue labeled `Good first issue`. You can filter for these.

### As a senior

If you've been contributing to Kindly for a while (Thanks! ✨) and are quite comfortable with the tech stack and code base:

- Check first for any Issues with the status `Blocked`
- If you have been given access along with the core team, help the development by reviewing any pending Pull Requests before starting a new Issue
- Check for any Issues labeled `High Priority`
- Consider pairing up with a less experienced developer dipping into a more complex issue - part of the ethos for Kindly is sharing knowledge

## Finally

Have fun! 🎡
