## Installation

To run the Kindly application locally:

Fork the `enbloc-org/kindly` project to your personal github profile.  
You can do this by finding the `fork` button on the top-right corner of our repo.

Clone your new project into a local repository:

```bash
git clone [url-to-your-forked-repo-here]
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd kindly
```

With Node.js 20, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Add `env` variables:

The `.env.example` file in the root directory shows what variables you will need.  
Follow the guidance below on setting up your local instance and obtain the relevant Supabase variables.

## Setting up your development database

Kindly uses Supabase to serve its _postgres_ database. You will need to setup a local container to run a development instance of the database.

### Install docker

You will need to have docker installed and running before following the next steps. Find the latest version [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Once it is installed, start your docker console and make sure there are no outstanding updates.

You don't need to do anything else within docker for now. A container will be created in the next steps.

### Supabase CLI

The CLI will allow you to set up the schema and seed your local copy of the kindly database. You can find more comprehensive guidance in the [official docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started) but we've outlined below the commands you will need to run in order to get started.

We have added to the repo a migration file and a seed file for the database, so you will only need to log into supabase with the following command:

```bash
npx supabase login
```

This will take you to the browser to complete a login. Then you will need to start your container with the following command:

```bash
npx supabase start
```

This script will run the migration file to set up your schema and then will run the `supabase/seed.sql` file to populate the database with some test data.

You should see the new "kindly" container in your docker console now.

Your terminal will have logged a series of details that will look something like this:

```bash
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
service_role key: eyJh......
```

You can view these details again at any time by running the following command:

```bash
npx supabase status
```

Copy the following values:

- `API URL` value into your `.env` file as the value of our `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `anon key` value as our `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` value
- `service_role key` as our `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` value

Your local development is now ready âœ¨

You can use the `Studio URL` provided to view and edit your local supabase project if needed.

You can also run all migration files and re-seed the database whenever necessary with the following command:

```bash
npx supabase db reset
```

This will set your local project back to the latest committed state and re-populate all data.

### Setting Up Supabase Bucket

To store and serve images, Kindly uses a bucket in Supabase. You need to create and configure this bucket manually:

1. Open the 'Studio URL' in your web browser
2. Navigate to the "Storage" section
3. Create a new bucket named 'images'
4. Set the bucket to be public to ensure it can be accessed without authentication

ðŸ’¡ Note: The bucket and its configuration will be lost if you reset the database or destroy the container. Make sure to create the bucket once again if you reset your environment.

## Managing Database Migrations:

Now that you are working from a local instance of the database you will need to handle Migration files in order to version-control any changes made to our supabase project.

You can find more detailed guidance on how to handle migrations in the Supabase [official documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/managing-environments?queryGroups=environment&environment=staging#auto-schema-diff)

We have helpfully included a script in the `package.json` to help create a new migration file:

```
npm run migrate insert-your-file-name
```

Make sure to replace **insert-your-file-name** with a name that describes your changes to the database.

## Running the app:

Make sure you are on the dev branch then use

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

Once you have kindly running on your machine read the [contribution guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md)
then go to the project and assign yourself an issue or create and issue yourself. Look for ones marked as good first issues.
